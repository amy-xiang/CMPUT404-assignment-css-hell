            <p>
              Hello, My name is Amy, I’m in my last semester at the University
              of Alberta studying Computer Science with a minor in Business. My
              most recent experience is working as a software developer co-op at
              Intuit where I was able to dig my hands into backend and platform
              technologies such as search and conversational UI. I learned many
              skills such as how to lead and communicate with developers and
              users on implementing key features, how to use technologies that
              are new to me like AWS, Splunk, and Kotlin, while strengthening my
              existing skills portfolio like Java, React, and the use of
              Atlassian tools. But the most important thing I’ve learned from my
              internship is that I just want to use my knowledge and skills, to
              solve problems and make an impact. I think Twitter is a great
              place for that opportunity because it’s a platform that reaches
              millions of people, becoming an integral part of our lives,
              sharing ideas, news, movements, and I would love to become a part
              of the engine that makes free expression possible. In summary what
              I bring to the table is being a leader, a learner, and a problem
              solver.
